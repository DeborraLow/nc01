The project’s charge was to address the large subject of biodiversity in relation to ecological questions in the equally vast and diverse nation of Indonesia. The winning curators, along with the selected artists, would be given the opportunity to go on a journey to the Indonesian archipelago in order to inspire the content of their proposed project."

How could we ‘know’ a subject or place solely as the result of a filtered or mediated experience and aesthetic, placed at a remove from the ‘authentic’, or the ‘real’ confrontation? After all, palm oil moistens our lips and skins, and smiling, endangered species feature happily on our cereal packaging."

In fairness, we were more inclined to explore the global stakes and agendas behind modes of representing the ‘natural world’ than to work around the specificity and complexity of Indonesian biodiversity, which we felt was not ours to speak about. Finally, we pulled our eyes away from Internet articles, imperial travelogues, and business plans, in favour of real encounters and conversations with artists and activists across Indonesia, whose first-hand experiences put the information we had consumed in a different light."

Yet images of biodiversity hotspots only offer a partial view. Their high profile of coincides with a tendency to concentrate conservation efforts on zones in the world with high terrestrial concentrations of endemic species, in order to be more ‘effective’ and ‘impactful’, while disregarding less diverse areas."

The contemporary notion of ‘nature as economy’ has its roots in nineteenth century, colonial, scientific discovery and eco-imperialist narratives, influenced by the legacy of the eighteenth century, Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy. In his dissertation <i>Oeconomia naturae</i> (1749), Linnaeus described the ‘economy of nature’ as its orderliness and its harmonious equilibrium. Linnaeus’ classification theory, though stereotypical and erroneous, shaped work by naturalists such as Charles Darwin, who in turn influenced German biologist Ernst Haeckel in the foundation of  ecology as a discipline. In the making of natural knowledge by means of systemic illustrations, maps, tables, and diagrams of species, Linnaeus contributed to the construction of new rational systems of classifying nature.<sup>1</sup> One could argue that Linnaeus’ foundational work, based as it was around ‘notions of equilibria’ as ‘checks and balances and feedback loops’,<sup>2</sup> already served as the groundwork for understanding nature as capital."

This indifference toward indigenous knowledge still holds today, as CELIA LOWE argues in her contribution <i>Making The Monkey</i> — a plea for a ‘postcolonial refiguration, not only of how science’s matter is made but of where and by whom’. In the island archipelago of the Dutch East Indies (now the Republic of Indonesia), it was Alfred Russel Wallace who was making nature by structurally assembling a large collection of animals and plants. Describing and visualising them as scientific specimens in his travel chronicles, he too reinforced a Cartesian dualism between human and nonhuman, contributing — perhaps unwittingly — to the modern devaluation of diverse life-forms."

The design of maps, as grids laid over natural landscapes, turned insular, opaque, illegible land, into visible, controllable territory and resources. One of the most renowned colonial maps is the meticulously detailed map of Java by the Dutch-German botanist and geologist Friedrich Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn, which ‘provided both evidence of the colonised territory and an instrument for its further domination.’<sup>4</sup> Not only did the map serve as an imperial weapon of ‘colonial domination guiding explicit military campaigns’, it also facilitated ‘resource extraction and plantation management’.<sup>5</sup> This spatial colonisation, through strategies of both literally and metaphorically mining the landscape’s resources was accompanied by a cultural colonisation, supported and made visible by the Mooie Indie movement. Exemplifying the concept of the ‘aesthetical service’ provided by nature — a discreet and insidious application of the notion of natural capital — , artists of the Dutch Indies specialised in a genre of painting which captured romantic depictions of the country; landscape scenes, showing volcanoes, mountains, river valleys, and villages emerging in golden sunshine. The style Mooie Indie, its title coming from the eponymous series of paintings by the Dutch artist Fredericus Jacobus van Rossum du Chattel, contributed to propagating an image of an idyllic nature, conceived for our enjoyment. Far before any form of digital imagery or photo documentation, artists were playing a crucial role in mediating Indonesia’s natural landscape to the world."

Throughout the twentieth century, economic, cultural, and environmental injustice remained firmly in place in Indonesia, despite the country’s colonial independence, evidenced, for example, by deforestation, the displacement of peoples and animals, the depletion of the earth’s resources, and the exploitation of cheap and unpaid labor. On the other hand, awareness about the planet’s fragility and uniqueness slowly grew. In 1969, architect Buckminster Fuller published his acclaimed essay <i>Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth<sup>6</sup>,</i>offering an apt metaphor for a new ideal of planetary management. Yet universalising ideas of a ‘whole earth’, a ‘Blue Marble’, or  a new ‘ecology’ as a systems-oriented view of the natural world proved to be biased and incomplete, once again representing the world as a totality to be governed."

Where one might imagine clean oceans and healthy forests to be priceless, they are often understood as global assets valued in economic terms as ‘natural capital’. The term ‘natural capital’ was coined by Ernst Friedrich Schumacher in 1973 as an economic concept that we have come to understand as the world’s assets of natural resources — such as air, water, and soil — capable of flowing into goods and services. The idea of describing natural resources not as ‘income’ but as ‘capital’ subject to depletion coincided with a growing awareness of the value of nature. But by describing the value of nature only in economic terms, we collapse its intrinsic worth into a system of capital flow and exchange, rather than bearing with other possible narratives such as speculation or care. No doubt, there must be more liberating and emancipatory concepts to describe the natural commons than their current management, quantification, and representation under the banner of ‘natural capital’."

According to Demos, we need to develop an alternative visual culture and vocabulary in order to combat the geoengineering solutions offered by techno-utopians whose visual culture ‘reinforces humanity’s mastery of nature through digital satellite photography and data visualizations in the form of maps, graphs, and virtual simulations.’ <sup>10</sup> In this regard, we can observe a change.

In De Certeau’s words, “Stories are becoming private and sink into the secluded place in the neighbourhoods, families, or individuals […] while memories are a sort of anti-museum: it is not localizable.”<sup>1</sup> Yet, the invisible builds up into layers and layers which make up a place."

Travel (like walking) is a substitute for the legends that used to open up space to something different—the return to nearby exoticism by way of a detour through distance places.<sup>2</sup> Each time when I return from my erratic escape, I invite someone (an artist, musician, historian, etc.) for a residency to explore whether my fascination of this place is sharable. The residency itself is a slow developing process which started in early 2014. The slowness is one of the visible qualities of Kaliurang that I implemented in curating 900mdpl. Away from the hustle bustle of the city of Yogyakarta; Kaliurang is the place where quiet streets are surrounded by lush greenery, cool air, tranquillity, and only the faint sound of the neighbour chit-chats flowing with the wind every now and then."

To open up a private house and share it with other people for a long period of time can be challenging. It requires trust, comfort, intimacy, and openness. This is applied not only in the physical presence of the house and the role of the host in welcoming the guest; but also in its non-physical present of the stories and local legends—whether or not the host, the native people of Kaliurang, are willing to share the stories to the visitors. Stories can be very personal and openness allows one to become vulnerable.

At this point, the conversation about cultural identity and roots as capital begins. In this case, my position as a native was something I considered a privilege as a host—something to always be conscious about and to only use in moderation.

My root, as one of the member of the society, soon translated into an asset—a non-monetary capital of infrastructures that does not belong to me. It is something that I would take for granted until someone pointed it out and call it by its name. It was not only because to contribute something to the project gives them a sense of belonging to the project; but also, we share the same concern—an impulse to make a note, to remember, and to archive. For example, one of the oldest members of the community approached me the other day in a waiting room; he began telling me a long comprehensive story about his ancestors and the family line. He even offered to write them down for me so that I could revisit the notes one day. That was the first time I actually had a long conversation with him so I asking him why he would burst into sharing such comprehensive oral history with me; and he said, “Because I know you believe in nonsense and you care enough to preserve it”. For me, that is the least that I can do."

In Javanese cosmological symbolism, Merapi is one of three ruling ‘kingdoms’ within Yogyakarta; the three ruling kingdoms are connected through the sacred axis—from the northern point Mt.Merapi; the centre point the Tugu Monument and Kraton the Palace of the King of Yogyakarta; and the southern point the domain of the Queen of the Southern Sea. All of which are bounded in a mutual relationship between one another.<sup>5</sup>"

What is seen to the eyes as <i>lahar</i>, lava flow, stones, and hot cloud are believed to be the troop of spirits that inhabited the great kingdom of Mount Merapi who needs to make their way to the sea every once in a while. Each time there is a major eruption, the people who resides near the mountain needs to give way to the spirits and move for a certain period of time. Each time an eruption occurs, the people who live at the slope of the volcano believe that the kingdom of Mt.Merapi celebrates—the eruption is considered as a process of rejuvenation, granting the people in the slope with ash rain that makes the land fertile. It was not until Mt.Merapi changed shape in 2010 has people started to fear him. Along with the changing shape and explosive tendency, Mt.Merapi feels foreign and threatening. In the big eruption in 2010, 320,000 people were evacuated from the dangerous area and the death toll was more than 350 casualties. The aftermath left many villages burned down and buried in ashes. For the first time in many years, the volcano triggered paranoia among people with such a real threat and danger. The sense of impermanence is getting stronger; especially in populated places that has proximity to the crater. Kaliurang, 8 kilometres away from the crater, is pulsing with a silent sense of temporality. This was the starting point of my impulse to archive the stories of the people, the specificity of the sites, and the collective memories."

The first owner opened the shop in 1930 and was a legendary cook well-known for her remarkable cuisine which she served for the royal family; the daughter who was the second generation was a persistent business-woman who turned the shop into a go-to place for everyone in the region, selling everything from local delicacies to Dutch chocolate and German cologne. The third generation of the shop owner is a man who chooses a quieter path with profound passion for antiques and history of mundane objects from all over the world. Simon Kentgens is an artist from Rotterdam who chose to work with the owner of Warung Joyo, the antique shop. He explores the shop as some kind of social space where not only products get exchanged, but also news, anecdotes, gossip, and history. As a result, he presented a video work containing short explanation on why a certain object is special to the owner.  How trivial these objects sometimes seem to be, they can show us our interdependency with local and global economies, history, our neighbours and the world. At the same time, he creates a dry museum-like cataloguing of the items being sold in the shop and posts it in  <a href=\"http://instagr.am/warung_joyo\" target=\"_blank\">instagram</a>. Can a local shop function as some sort of museum of contemporary relations? One in which these objects and stories are not fixed, like in a traditional museum, but constantly moving, changing and exchanging?"

For most of his lifetime, Lik Sigun used to live in that house, undisturbed by the world that going by around him. He owned a motorcycle that which he had decorated with the Indonesian flag but instead of riding it, he would take it for a walk on regular basis. He learned self-defence to protect those he cared the most. He made sword in the middle of the night using scraps of metal he collected on the way. When his goat died, instead of burying it, he tied the animal’s four legs on the house poles to let it rotten and dried. Three years ago, he went missing in the forest of confusion, not yet to be found. Taking on his own method in painting, Maryanto let the grass overgrown the remnant of the house to later trim the weed and highlight the part where the ‘artworks’ made by Lik Sigun are hidden; creating a conceptual landscape of remembrance."

Up until now we can find Dutch architecture and other recognizable traces in these areas. For Mella Jaarsma who was born in Emmeloord, in the Netherlands and left for Indonesia in the 80’s, Kaliurang is where she got her shot of nostalgic fixed. In her words: “One small house in central Kaliurang,- reminded me of my grandmother’s house in the Netherlands, is where I sometimes go since the eighties, in order to get my shot of nostalgias, fresh air and a cup of hot chocolate. For this project I will bring you to Vogels, a traveller’s café in the centre of Kaliurang with co-owner Pak Christian, who in the past brought people up the Merapi Mountain and has many stories to tell, while I will serve you a shot of hot and cold to activate your senses.”"

This study is now being presented in the form of a publication and a retrospective exhibition of the anonymous photography group that later referred as “Kelompok Fotografi Kaliurang” (Kaliurang Photography Collective). Through this history of itinerant tourist photography practices, not only can we get an overview of the economic aspects of tourism specifically in Kaliurang, but also learning about the history of the region, the social relations between the local and the newcomers, the political power that works in the realm of photography during the New Order era through a national campaign of “Tourism Awareness” <i>(Kampanye Sadar Wisata)</i>, and the fall of Polaroid industry."

His presence in the community is transient, thus, it amazes him to see how closely-knit the community is. He considered that this special closeness of the Kaliurang community could be the result of living together under the continuous looming danger of the volcano. Yet, in spite of danger, it is the comfort of living in Kaliurang which keeps people coming back, resulting in longstanding composition of inhabitants. Soon enough he made new friends while responding to different interactions by producing new artworks for what he later refers as his ‘solo exhibition’. In no time, he start mimicking local activities by trading handmade walking sticks, volunteering on the afternoon school for senior citizens by creating an acting class, and get himself involved in the local’s endless attempt to promote the area. All of which are wrapped into a show called Anjelir, musing on a song with same title written by a local activist for Kaliurang elderly while putting the elder member of the society back in the spotlight and archive their presence through playcard called ‘Gambar Umbul Kaliurang’."

For this work, she chose a storage room that used to be a shop by the street where neighbours are passing by. During her first residency, she collected information about several well-known types of vegetation that were indigenous to Kaliurang and how it interconnected with the locals. When she starts tracing the passage of the plants, she vaguely saw a plant circulation map brimming with human touch. This distinctive dissemination pattern portrays its communal connectedness. As the result, she discovered an exceptional bond between plants and the people of Kaliurang that she presented in “Botanica 1.1: Vanda Tricolor and Other Findings”. Instead of finding the formal dissemination of the native plants, she found out how unreserved the way people in Kaliurang socialized and exchange with their neighbours. This time, Edita tries to simulate this exchange by preparing a non-monetary trading space called “Taman Tukar” (Swap Garden) especially to accommodate people around Kaliurang to meet their neighbours, exchange domestic plants, and share information about them. All the information are documented and openly displayed for public access."

This project, initiated as the subprime mortgage crisis started to be noticed, ventured to protect citizens from the effects of air pollution and climate change. Working to add the eponymous amount of trees to the city, MTNYC was considered the largest urban afforestation effort in the world. Highlighting the benefits of improved air quality, increased shading, and reduced energy consumption, the majority of trees were planted in low income neighborhoods with poor tree canopy and high asthma rates. The aspiration was to increase the city’s “urban resilience” in times of devaluation of real estate assets and ecological collapse. The project was accompanied by an extensive community-based survey that invited people to document trees in their neighborhood. This promoted the caretaking and mapping of the different species by involving  “the community” in that process. Volunteers contributed 12,000 hours of their own time, worth an estimated $100,000, inventorying the city’s trees. As a consequence, each single tree in the city was assigned an economic value based on the “environmental services” it performed."

Is this a second wave of what David Gissen refers to as “environmental gentrification” initiated in NYC during the 1970s? Before current quantifications that assign figures and formulae to plants, their value was extracted in a more direct way. When British Empire forestry was first established as a disciplinary practice in India, formalizing the right of the state over “nature,” it proscribed private interests and initiated a new system of forest management based on a logic of utilitarian preservation. Rather than the actual survival of plants or animals, the goal of this forestry was focused on preventing the exhaustion of resource extraction. Using the universal goodness of plants to prevent indigenous peoples from living off the forest for the sake of the “environment,” Empire forestry eventually masqueraded a form of biopolitical control, limiting access to the forest for its original dwellers. Furthermore, the extraction of commodities from every single tree (timber, rubber, or pharmaceutical substances) has been used as a form of ecocracy throughout history: controlling space and people through the conservation of ecology. This conservation paradigm implied that the ruling class could keep extracting material resources from trees without exhausting the forest. As Arun Agrawal articulates with his notion of environmentality, much before the pacifist Chipko movement of the 1970s, the reclassification of forests into designated reserves led villagers in Northern India to resist becoming environmental subjects through violent actions. They started hundreds of forest fires in the early 1920s to protest colonial British regulations that were passed to “protect the environment” from the harms the Empire itself inflicted."

The extraction of value from trees does not imply subtraction of physical matter (sap, bark, leaves, roots, or oil extracts), but rather precisely by keeping all that materiality intact and in place. Trees have turned into carbon reserves that are to be protected from any form of indigenous, domestic, or industrial usage, so that they keep acting as fixed carbon sinks. Contemporary struggles in Niassa, Mozambique against the neocolonial logic of “afforestation projects” reflect similar uprisings in early twentieth century India, where forests are being “preserved” to offset air pollution in cities of the global North. In protest of consequent land dispossessions, thousands of pine trees planted by multinational “Green Resources” corporation were uprooted in 2013."

Utilizing the Tree Carbon Calculator (TCC), a federally approved spreadsheet developed by the Center for Urban Forest Research, the yearly capacity of stormwater interception, energy conservation, air pollutant removal, and CO2 reduction prefigures each tree on the database. Plugging this latter set of information into an algorithm behind environmental investment software allows the TCC to accurately calculate the annual financial benefits provided by each one of those trees, which developers or industrialists who have to mitigate their environmental damage can pay to “neutralize” the detrimental effect of their activities."

Today, however, the Ford Foundation atrium is losing greenwashing capacity to the six thornless honey locusts right outside, on 309 East 42nd street, and another six in front of the façade on 320 East 43rd street. They measure between three and eleven inches in diameter. One of them in particular intercepts ten dollars and twelve cents worth of stormwater, conserves one hundred and fifteen dollars and fifty one cents worth of energy, removes eight dollars and twenty-one cents worth of air pollutants, sequesters one dollar and thirty-eight cents worth of CO2, providing a total of $136.59 in annual benefits."

Throughout the five boroughs of NYC, all mapped trees are annually providing one hundred and ten million, six hundred and seventy-three thousand, seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars and twenty cents. Now marked with a fully articulated and mathematically sound price tag, trees can automatically become objects of transaction and start to offset environmental damage from any development elsewhere. Planting trees is thus the outcome of an emerging and carefully engineered government of financial flows: the cartography of street trees constitutes a dataset for the calculation of “environmental services” (the services that nature suddenly provides to humans). By means of the software, these services can be turned into “financial gains” that the city can start accumulating by benefiting from environmental destruction."

At the same time, their newly assigned role expropriates all kinds of inhabitants of the city from their environment, as the main aim of the trees is to become a public asset for developers. The degree of authority of those paying for the environmental services of each tree is uncertain, despite the trees being rooted in public soil. In this case, what is conserved is not just trees to improve air quality in the city, but also its real estate capital flows. Humans and other-than-humans thus become financial victims of conservation. Trees that provide environmental services for offsetting purposes could, as has happened in places like India or Mozambique, be prioritized over aesthetic, health, or ecological concerns."

According to No Net Loss, any development that destroys natural habitats (especially wetlands, streams or vernal pools) has to be recouped by the restoration of an “equivalent” landscape elsewhere. The net amount of biodiversity is meant to remain “the same” in terms of surface, quality, or quantity. For each acre of lost wetland, for instance, there should be at least one acre created or restored. This one-for-one logic becomes perverse when the idea of preservation gets thrown into the mix: a developer can destroy a forest for the construction of a condominium on site A and pay a third-party entity owning an equivalent amount of trees on site B to preserve them. Like the trading of air-rights to build higher developments, this logic of urban afforestation has evolved into more sophisticated forms. Air pollution can be legitimized as long as it is traded with planting and keeping trees untouched that absorb the equivalent amount of CO2. The US government has recently updated its social cost of carbon to $37 a ton, which refers to the total social and environmental benefits that accrue from avoiding the emission of one ton of CO2, or alternatively, the damage done by releasing that ton of CO2. Once these equivalences are set, trading can easily commence."

Offsetting becomes a financial practice that swaps destruction here with reconstruction, or preservation there. Eventually, spatial offsets are directly entangled with the offsetting, and obfuscation of responsibility. As María Gutiérrez remarks, even if such a mechanism of spatial offsetting was to be considered environmentally sensitive, it is not clear yet who is accountable if, for instance, the mitigation forest catches fire or succumbs to a disease, releasing all the “stored carbon” back into the atmosphere. Hence, environmental mitigation and holding trees accountable as a solution remains nebulous."

In the 1980s biologists shifted from providing facts about the natural world (already social constructions themselves) to start speaking of nature’s “values.” As facts were not enough, subjective valuation of nature started playing a more ambiguous active role, malleable enough to different economic interests. There are many ways of valuing, but unlike the concept of wilderness, the moment “natural variety” appeared (the fact that species are different and contribute differently to the ecological balance of a habitat), the gradients of environmental importance to biodiversity easily became a commodity that could be compared, exchanged, lost, gained, depleted, restored, quantified, and scientized; allowing metaphors such as “balance of nature” to disguise poor understandings of ecology."

Air pollution in the Global North was accepted as a lesser evil of modernization if compensated with “sustainable” afforestation programs in the Global South that “enhanced global biodiversity.” Offset forest projects turned environmental guilt into a tradable commodity. Rich nations became entitled to keep polluting as long as they ensure that impoverished nations keep their forests intact, or their land grabbed to green the planet. Some of the ethical contradictions in this postcolonial logic were obviously reinstating abusive power dynamics within a pseudo-environmentalist discourse, as in one of the first post-Kyoto offsetting projects, where US-based Applied Energy Services promised to plant millions of trees on the highland hills of Western Guatemala in exchange for permission to construct a large, coal-burning power station in Connecticut. This “participatory” planting project, branded as Mi Bosque, was calculated to absorb as much CO2 from the environment as would be produced by the power station over its lifetime. It was meant to sequester between 15.5 and 16.3 million tons of carbon over 40 years, but according to a report, only 270,000 tons of carbon were offset by the project over the first ten years. Therefore, the ways in which any carbon footprint is neutralized through corporate social responsibility only exacerbates the still-colonial relationships between the rich and the poor, between high carbon-emitting nations’ right to pollute and enjoy and low carbon-emitting nations obligation to cleanse and labor."

Nations and companies are competing to appropriate the last piece of available “untapped” forest that can provide the most amount of “environmental services.” A green space race to designate space itself as a protected zone. Eco-utilities and forest bonds are some of the instruments that are boosting the neoliberal quantification of space embedded in that process and determining how to classify and demarcate it. The main challenge for this form of speculation, however, is how and whether to make offsetting calculations standard and universal. In order to securitize ecology, the definition of the “values” of each single tree are crucial. For that operation, standard measurements to quantify forests properties would be necessary. However, such agreement on a transnational form of currency or valuing units has yet to happen. No governmental body has proven offsetting mechanisms as simultaneously financially efficient and environmentally successful."

Ernst Friedrich Schumacher further articulated this morphology when, after the 1973 oil crisis and the accessibility of fossil fuels was under threat for Western powers, he posited the idea of natural capital. Further still, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins expanded the lexicon into the notion of natural capitalism at the end of the twentieth century, framing natural capitalism within the notion of eco-efficiency—how to make sense of nature by making money—and arguing that environmental sensitivity is so necessary to shareholders that for the sake of business, corporations should be careful not to miss out. Natural capitalism did not refer to capitalism as being a natural phenomenon to humanity, as it was misunderstood at the time, but as something embedded in the trading of nature. This vision implies that the environment has its own assets waiting for human stewards to make the most of them."

Hence, the rise of stewardship principles reflects the spatiality of a neoliberal economy, legitimizing environmental protection in order to regulate the extraction of value. This process of raising awareness about the value of trees for the city is equivalent to the so-called “Cousteauization” of the oceans: a popular movement to cultivate public interest in the ocean’s biota, through figures like Captain Jacques Cousteau, in order to generate financial support for further marine research and governmental and/or corporate stewardship of marine resources. In that regard, neoliberal environmental conservation can extract even more value by “protecting” nature in order to further boost the speculation on its exploitation, be it real estate potential or prospective natural resources. This perverse logic profiteering from environmental protection is what Bram Büscher and Robert Fletcher frame as “accumulation by conservation.”"

On the contrary, they will carry on instrumentalizing “resilience” in order to create new markets. New forms of capital are monetizing the environment through the banking of nature. Increasingly after the collapse of the housing market in 2007–2008, an ever-increasing number of international investors and credit institutions shifted their activity from real estate speculation to trading natural capital. What we are observing in New York is just one example of a booming market in which inhabitants of the city are environmentally dispossessed by a price tag on its trees. In this transformation process, a neighborhood like East New York, comprised of a population of which more than 50% live under the poverty line, is now becoming one of the highest valued areas of urban trees in the whole city, generating annual benefits of millions of dollars in environmental services for offsetting powers. Very quickly some of the most vulnerable people in the city could be also offset, swept away under a new speculative market where the environment serves as a driving force for new forms of dispossession, real estate speculation, and green “renewal.” The offsetted (humans and other-than-humans) are a new social class that stands not to be displaced, but replaced by trees. Trees might be purifying the air on-site, but the financial value of each tree does not stay in front of citizens’ houses. The double agenda of calculating the carbon footprint for each tree, and the services it provides, exposes how every tree of New York is connected to a very specific architectural site of destruction. It is the responsibility of architects and realtors to de-quantify the “value” of trees instead of profiteering from them and what they offset."

This was the subject of books such as <i>The Migrant Image</i> where I was looking at a wide field of artistic practices investigating conditions of migration—of people but also of images—in an age of increasing reproduction and dissemination of digital imagery. This was an entrance into how to think and critique the claims of triumphalist globalisation in the 90s and the fact that we have entered a period of post-Cold War, and a new world order of global equalisation, open travel, the collapse of borders, and a new kind of “flat earth”. New and longstanding antagonisms continue in relationship to colonial legacies, and there is an argument that colonialism is not simply in the past but continues today. Not simply in places like Israel and Palestine, but also through the effects of neo-colonialism and the financialisation of markets. If you are looking to this wider field, then ecology and environmentalism, which impact not only humans but also the natural world, are an organic part of the crisis of globalisation. Decolonizing Nature was an attempt to bring methodologies of decoloniality, which I found are increasingly important to give us a critical lens on what is happening today in term of the structural conditions, but also on our thinking about environmentalism. Because there is a danger—as you may know—for environmentalism to become a white, middle class type of discourse and practice that involves recycling and ethical consumerism, green technology, etc. I wanted to connect the practices, discourses of social movements and activism around protecting wilderness zones, natural landscapes or animal life to social justice and environmental justice campaigns, in order to ultimately address ‘black lives matter’—the way communities of colour or communities of the Global South are particularly vulnerable to the development of the global industry in the North. In the book, I was really insistent in opening up artistic practices that are not just Northern European or North American analyses, but attempted to look at a distributed variety of practices all over the world. The thesis developed in<i>Against the Anthropocene</i> connects to this project of decoloniality, but more specifically by looking at new claims that are equally potentially triumphalist, celebratory or fantasy-based. The Anthropocenethesis itself, which is regressive in terms of returning to human anthropocentrism and human exceptionalism, avoids recognising the disproportionate impact of climate change that affects some people more than others. The reasons for this have to do with class, race, gender and geographical distribution. The book is a particular attempt to critique the Anthropocene thesis. It proposes a different critical vocabulary orcritical perceptual lenses and methodologies by drawing on decolonial forms emerging out of the indigenous histories and ways of talking about law and the economy, and social and human practices."

From my understanding, within the North American context, it comes out of African American legal theories, recognizing, for example, the fact that oppression cannot be contained within one category ofexperience like race. Black women, for instance, are subject to multiple potential forms of micro aggressions or racial inequalities, but also gender, class and religious based inequalities—the relationality between different vectors of oppression. Since intersectionality insists on an interdisciplinary form of connectivity, it is also potentially related to ecology as a science of connectivity between organisms and their environments. Part of my project has been to explore ways of thinking about ecology as a mode of intersectionality, as well as transversality, which is another useful ontology coming out of the French psychoanalytic, post-structuralism context and particularly the work of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari. In <i>Chaosophy</i> and <i>The Three Ecologies</i> Guatarri investigates the term transversality, which means we have to think about ways of understanding the organisation and the regulation of experience through specific ecologies or system theories, including the psychological, social, and environmental system, and how to connect those realms. On the one hand, there is the Guattarian transversality, which is useful because it insists on thinking not just from the human realm but also from the non-human realm in relationship to ecology. On the other hand, there is intersectionality, which insists on biopolitics of the human in relationship to race, gender, class, etc. To bring those two together and think them in relation to one another really opens things up, exploding the terrain in really productive and interesting ways."

This is the side that I support, but that does not mean that environmental activists are not open to technological approaches. It is not as if radical ecology has to support some eco-primitivism or return to a pre-modern past. We have to draw on green technologies to decarbonise. We also have to insist on the precautionary principle, which is the condition for transparent democratic and inclusive forms of evaluation and regulations before we enact any form of environmental transformation – from the smallest type of impact to the global widest one. It is problematic for the ecomodernist position to propose the mobilisation of technologies like eco-engineering as a technofix to escape from the dangers of the climate crisis. I think that position is fundamentally flawed and based on potential enormous catastrophic ramifications. Especially since geo-engineering is really risky and can bring unforeseen consequences and on the parts of the world it can affect regional climate systems in ways that aren’t fully understood because there is no democratic accountability, no regulations, no form or global environmental governance. It is a completely unaccountable, non-democratic technoscientific elitist practice. So it is not surprising that places that are playing with this idea of geo-engineering are wealthy countries—the US and European countries—often supported by technocrats and billionaires, like Bill Gates for instance. There is a currently a project at Harvard university, that will represent the first large-scale experiment in the atmosphere of technologies of solar radiation management. That is the first ever, and there is no governance, no debate. We are on a train towards addressing our future through these technological approaches and it is very difficult to get off that train (the so-called ‘locked-in effect’)."

And yet it is very hard to know what to believe or where it comes from.

It requires a continual investigative approach to media and a critical perception. I always try to ask: Where has the story been generated? How can we verify it with different sources?

Moore’s book <i>Capitalism in the Web of Life,</i> where he investigates how since the fifteenth century economic arrangements have come together with natural systems. You have ‘capitalism and nature’, and ‘nature and capitalism’—an interdependent development that has moved through early globalisation, colonialism and imperialism processes of researching nature and exploiting it, even when capitalism itself depended on those resources as well. Linnaeus and this taxonomic knowledge is part of the calculating machine of how to exploit those systems. There is a progressive approach to natural capital, which is of course to say that nature is valuable, not simply to human economic systems, but also to the viability of life and its biodiverse forms that have also allowed for humans to exist. The proposal of natural capital is to marketise nature and evaluate its economic worth, not simply as a site of exploitation, but to see what sort of services nature provides in economic terms. According to a number of people, it is a well-intended project, but I still think it is problematically stuck into a mode of thinking economically. This relates to what Foucault called <i>Homo Economicus</i>—the attempt to see everything in monetary terms as if we can only understand value if it is attached to the euro or the dollar. There are also non-economistic cultural approaches to value, like indigenous ones, that see nature as a site of sacredness. If nature has a scared value, then it is infinitely valuable. You cannot put a price tag on that."

If there is a system that is irrational, then it is that one. If we look at the so-called systems of indigenous, religious cultural values or practices, we have to put in perspective that they have survived thousands and thousand of years without doing terrible global damage to the earth’s natural systems. That is not to idealise indigeneity, because of course there have been cases of animal extinctions and environmental transformations that have been damaging ecosystems. Yet, nothing on the scale of global capitalist modernity, which is putting life, as we know it, at risk. We are in the midst of a mass species extinction event and we know this is a scientific fact. Researchers, like David Wallace-Wells in his article </i>The Inhabitable Earth,</i> are claiming that we are looking at a near future of existence of life on earth that is incompatible with human civilisation. Western Modernity—whether its exists from the fifteenth century to today, or from antiquity to today—is nothing compared to the nearly 50.000 years of indigenous histories. Of course, no one is proposing to return to a pre-modern form of life, but we have to somehow integrate these ways of life and learn from them, instead of continuing to practice a colonial relation where we’re discounting and discriminating against because those conditions of injustice and colonial violence are continuing today. They are continuing in the states and they are continuing all over the world. So, it’s important to point out that we’re not moving into this direction, we’re moving further into the status quo and more forms of technological and ecological violence against people and the planet. My project is an attempt to somehow gather more momentum and join activists and environmental movements as well as indigenous struggles and critical thinkers within the academy. We need a movement of movements to try to reverse this tide towards ecocide and genocide."

One is that there is a song by Agnes Obel called <i>Words are Dead,</i> which I think speaks to our time, given the fact that we are part of a long societal development that is leading to disaster. We desperately need to think about our systems of communication. How does language provide way of understanding ourselves, each other, life, the history of our people and the future. My analysis of the Anthropocene is to bring out those implications. It’s not just the term, since it does ideologically and politically work. But the Anthropocene tends to disavow political analyses of environmental injustice of the past and privilege technoscientific solutions for the future. So, if we accept the premise that words are dead – that they have become corrupted, that the media has become fake—then maybe we need to reinvent them, and rethink conditions of words. Donna Haraway has for a long time tried to do that. The proposal she is famous for, the <i>Cyborg Manifesto</i> from 1984 when that word came out and started using it no one understood it - it sounded like the movies, like sci-fi or fantasy. But gradually the word starts to fill in meanings and takes on new resonances that have become widespread, like a global reference point for identifying or conditions of techno organic hybridity today, computer systems and artificial intelligence, robotics. It identified something that was going on and provided a language for understanding new conditions of life. Maybe Chthulucene also is such a term. I think that is something she is interested in, in relation to theoretical and speculative fabulation. I do not know if people will be taking it up widely. The idea is of course that we are living at a time that the notion of life’s interdependencies is becoming increasingly recognised and important. We do not exist in a vacuum. We cannot just go to Mars and create a new form of life, even if people are thinking that’ is one solution as well. We depend on all sorts of things, including the bacteria in our digestive systems, for survival. We are part of the web of life and we cannot escape that. So the Chthulucene thesis is an attempt to provide a critical vocabulary to identify that and name the era instead of the Anthropocene, which is again a proposal that is based on the enlightenment idea that humans are somehow discrete, separate and self-sustainable. But that's an irrational, mythological idea. The Chthulucene is a new proposal that is much more realistic than the Anthropocene."

If we need a ‘movement of movements’ then we need a multiplicity of ways of thinking, forms of sensibility, and modes of representation. But we do have to re-examine the constitution of the conventional artistic practices. If we look back historically, they tended to be based within systems of profound inequality. Art history is profoundly patriarchal and white, the way it has been institutionalised within dominant disciplinary systems particularly within the West, but that is becoming opened up with the globalisation of art history and artistic practices. We need to continue thinking about the fact that artistic practices often enclosed contained within institutional systems based within commodification and the idea of the art sold to wealthy patrons. That art system, whichhas been developing for the last hundreds of years is unsustainable, is inequitable and is anti-democratic. Instead, we are in the position where aesthetics—more broadly and outside of the limiting categories of art – is a form of sensibility, the invention of sensible modes of expression, feelings and knowledge. It can provide systems of materialization and visualisation. Not on only of critical environmentalism, or seeing forms of colonialism, or social injustice; they are also providing places of invention and new forms of relationalities, new forms of justice, new modes of environmental sustainability. My current research is investigating some of those forms. For instance the movement of Blockadia, or indigenous forms of protest camps. Like what we saw at Standing Rocks, North Dakota, where they are trying to shut down the Dakota access pipeline. We cannot really say it is an art project but it is not dissociated from aesthetics. It has visual systems, shared modes of sensibility, of knowledge production, of rituals, of visualisations. We see that happening in Indonesia, WHERE there are interesting practices that are focussing on mining, on palm oil, the plantationoscene, dealing with forms of environmentalism and history of social violence and colonialism there."

For her, it is crucial that the most vulnerable, the least resourced, the most disadvantaged people are brought to the table where the conversations are being had to decide about our future. For me, with a white male identity, based in North America, working within the academy, and leading a research centre for Creative Ecologies, that is something I am interested in moving towards. There are huge barriers to doing this, but we have to continue to be on the look for ways of attacking the appropriative colonial methodology.

Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1,000 times or more greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50–90%of the world’s languages will disappear by the end of this century. Prior studies indicate similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earth’s remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity. The results reported in this article provide a starting point for focused research exploring the relationship between biological and linguistic– cultural diversity, and for developing integrated strategies designed to conserve species and languages in regions rich in both."

While we all know that palm oil companies played a key role as the doer of these burnings, the local farmers got regulated. Ironically the palm oil companies never got blamed for it and were found not guilty."

Together these works address one of most heinous genocides of the 20th century, namely the mass killings that took place in 1965 and led to president Sukarno's displacement from power. Following the alleged coup by the members of the Communist Party (PKI) on September 30, 1965, General Suharto called for their prosecution, leading to the slaughter of about one million (alleged) communists. Possibly more. After this, Suharto remained in power for 32 more years. In 1998, he was eventually forced to resign as President of Indonesia under pressure of the population and the international political community. Today, Indonesians still talk about 1965-66, especially in the weeks prior to September. During that period, you'll see big banners throughout Indonesia with slogans saying \"Beware of Communism.\" This is absurd, of course, because Communism no longer exists in Indonesia.

In order for the Togean landscape to move from “poor in representatives” (as it was in 1865) to “rich in biodiversity” (which, by the mid-1990s, it had become), the “facts” of Togean biodiversity awaited their empirical demonstration and social emergence (Latour and Woolgar 1986; Shapin and Schaffer 1985). Such a representation of Togean nature was encompassed by the work of species inventory in the emergent field of conservation biology. Key to the appearance of biodiverse nature in the Togean Island was the Togean macaque, <i>Macaca togeanus,</i> a primate living in the upland forest of Malenge Island. Non-human primates have always held an inordinate fascination for biologists due to their role in the history of human evolution.

He had available to him 17 skins, 15 skulls, and 1 stuffed specimen of unknown provenance. Sody combined an analysis of these specimens with the literature on 40 other skulls including a Malenge Island series collected by J. J. Menden in the Togean Islands in 1939. In October 1949, not long after Indonesian independence, Sody published his synthesis in the journal of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Buitenzorg (Bogor). He found that the skull index for macaque males was larger than for females and was the greatest in Menden’s Malenge series. On the basis of its larger size, Sody proposed a “new form” which he named <i>Cynopithecus togeanus</i> (Sody 1949)."

The data did not convince him, however, that the Togean primate was a unique species, and Fooden believed that the difference between the macaques of Malenge and the mainland population was probably caused by “relatively recent evolution in isolation.” He found “no characters that warrant allocation of the insular form to a separate species, or even sub-species” (Fooden 1969:114).

This early research led to the formation of the Indonesian Foundation for the Advancement of Biological Sciences (IFABS), an independent biologically-focused NGO. Supriatna would be able to use the Togean project, not only for Indonesian nature conservation, but to develop an internationally recognized program of biological research. IFABS built its research station, Camp Uemata, to facilitate the primate research and to further their national scientific agenda (Surjadi and Supriatna 1998)."

Immediately after the conference ended, Russell Mittermeier, president of CI and a primatologist himself, visited the Togean archipelago with Supriatna and other IFABS staff. This visit brought Indonesian scientists and their project together with a funder under the banner of preserving what CI began to refer to as the “endemic Togean macaque” (Mackie 1994).<sup>1</sup> CI then granted preliminary funding to support the new IFABS organization and the Uemata field station.<sup>2</sup>"

Employing dermatoglyphics, a technique of determining relatedness through fingerprints pioneered by Froehlich, and by examining the bathymetric contours of the Gulf of Tomini to determine that the conditions necessary to produce a species isolate could have existed, they elaborated three possibilities for the primate’s taxonomic status: (1) M. togeanus is a third subspecies of <i>M. maurus;</i> (2) the Togean monkey is not subspecifically distinct from <i>M. tonkeana</i> (Fooden’s hypothesis); or (3) the primate deserves separate species status (Sody’s hypothesis).

They argued, “Comparably diagnosable pelage patterns, distinct alterations in body shape, and greater dermatoglyphic differences suggest that <i>M. togeanus</i> may be a valid species” (Froehlich and Supriatna 1996:65). Emphasizing the interpretation that supported separate species status, they proposed further research on the primate and an urgent conservation agenda. The “nonexistent protection and the tenuous status of the only known population of <i>M. togeanus</i> on Malenge Island lends urgency to the confirmation of these predictions and the formulation of adequate conservation initiatives” (Froehlich and Supriatna 1996:66). As the facticity of <i>M. togeanus</i> was beginning to “harden” (Latour 1988), the monkey was increasingly able to support a conservation agenda."

They don’t eat because of stress,” he added. “Are they endangered?” the volunteer with the camera asked him. “No, not endangered, but protected,” Supriatna replied. "

We built a trail through the forest and we made a “bell” and then a “plot.” A plot is an area 50 meters square where we counted the number and size of trees.

Or once, when an Indonesian biologist showed up late for a field excursion, I heard a white scientist proclaim, “that’s why they’re still beating on drums.” Most frustrating for this group of elite Indonesians was that foreign visitors to the camp were sometimes unable to make a distinction between Indonesian scientists and Togean villagers. The distinction between cosmopolitan scientists and rural Togean people, however, was one of the important social distinctions at stake for Indonesian experts in their scientific production of nature, and the field station was a place where “modern” and “traditional” identities were continually reinscribed.

The 35 million years that separates me from the Togean macaque <i>does</i> seem rather a long time to recon kinship and, as Franklin and McKinnon (2001:5) write, “Kinship provides a useful example of naturalization as knowledge because of the way in which kin ties are seen to be constituted out of primordial natural facts.”<sup>15</sup> Isra asked me about primate kinship because he himself had been brought to the Camp by IFABS in the hopes that he would internalize their conservation values. He learned many things about the conservation project while he was there, including the urgency of preserving the Togean monkey. One explanation he was given of its value was that it is our “ancestor.” But, he told me, he did not believe humans are related to animals at all. “God looks at humans differently than animals,” Isra said."

Indeed, the hill behind the Camp was somebody’s garden plot.

The monkey drew together the threads connecting Indonesian biologists to the traveling ideas of biodiversity extending across nations in the 1990s, while the scientists were also positioned within domestic ideas of nature and nation. In this way, Indonesian biologists became subjects of a universalizing project of scientific inquiry while simultaneously participating in the making of an Indonesian modernity that was historically and geographically distinct. In this double move, Indonesian modernity is not an “alternative” to something more central or originary. Indonesian conservation biology produces scientific reason in a manner that should be familiar from the many projects of knowledge production described by science studies scholars, while it is no less entangled with those issues of origin and identity outlined by theorists of postcoloniality."

A major division is between the “biologic” species concept and the “phylogenetic” species concept. The former emphasizes taxonomic relationships while the latter emphasizes evolutionary connections. The controversy has been described this way: Scientific theories direct attention to the relationships and interactions among things, or entities, thought to have an ontological status in nature. Theories themselves sometimes impart or predict the expectation of reality to things not known to exist. One only has to recall the predictions of particle physics or astronomy to appreciate this. Likewise, theories of evolution are theories about the descent and modification of entities. Biologists have traditionally called these entities “species,” but it is essential to remember that the term species has been used in many different ways. Moreover, it is widely recognized that taxonomic species as such have not always been accepted as the “units of evolution” by many biologists. Indeed, these “units” have been postulated to be genes, gametes, individual organisms, local demes, populations, varieties, subspecies, “biological species,” and even higher taxa. If this vast nomenclature signifies anything, perhaps it is the diversity of opinion that exists about the evolutionary process itself, for conceptions or theories about how nature is organized and has developed do influence opinions about the ontological status of the evolving entities.

A simple way of explaining the concept of the commons is that it is a form of sharing resources by a community without private or governmental intervention. This could concern inherited commons (for instance rivers, forests, air...), immaterial commons (for instance intellectual, cultural...) or material commons (for instance machinery). It concerns communal resources that are (or rather could be) managed collectively without identified ownership but with shared responsibility. Though the concept of the commons often remains in the topic of social processes, more and more artists, city planners, environmentalists, philosophers, designers and architects around the world are recognising ‘commoning’ as an interesting way of working against capitalism, which keep commodification, commercialisation and privatisation of resources at arm’s length. Indonesian urbanist Marco Kusumawijaya explains<sup>1</sup>: “communities can play an important role in moving towards a different paradigm that is not dominated by capitalism and neoliberal governments. Rather, communities can be the stewards of land and resources as well as being an essential place where relationships, alternatives, substitutes and critiques are constantly in the making.”<sup>2</sup>"

Indigenous knowledge is a product of the adaptation of farming practices to the local environment, creating unique practices that go hand in hand with creativity, culture and spirituality.

Deforestation and forest degradation are important environmental issues In Indonesia; about 1 million hectares of forest is decreasing every year. A needed transition from clearing to protecting is occurring (too) slowly. Environmental protection suffers from infrastructural bottlenecks and ineffective bureaucracy. In addition, corruption allows for illegal logging and unlawful licensing. The responsibility for licensing often shifts back and forth between national and local levels of the government.

The manual and guidelines are read as a poem. Art and cultural expression is integrated in the farming practices. There is a necessity to record and recognise the knowledge.

Van Dingenen encourages visitors to make pressings semiannually at the high tide of the moon with the goal of creating a new calendar, experimenting with forms of representations and different narratives besides the scientific study of the state of the seaweed (and an alternative approach to scientific study of the state of seaweed)."

The online publication features commissioned contributions and interviews with artists and theorists living in Indonesia, Belgium, and elsewhere, written in English and Bahasa Indonesia. The format of the online publication was conceived as a platform to enable artworks and ideas to travel outside of Belgium, to generate a new dimension of artistic production, and to bypass the constraints of the physical exhibition.

He often creates performative situations and experiences using the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire. Driven by intuition and artisanal savoir-faire, he combines sculpture, drawing, and organic materials (mushrooms, spices, wood, stone, chalk…) in installations that often deal with universal notions of craftsmanship, tradition, and community."

Her artistic practice bridges photography, video, performance, and sculpture, and delves into cultural notions of alienation, territorial belonging, gender, and identity. Nature serves as a source for the artist’s imagery and objects, which can be interpreted as both symbolic and indexical. In her recent works, Monosov lets the borders between private life and artistic performance blurr, therefore lets a questioning about authenticity, fantasy and fiction settle in her latest artworks. The act of presenting, representing and the communication between the artist the artwork and the public is of a growing importance in her practice.  While seemingly self-focussed and almost autobiographical, Monosov’s artworks subtly succeeds in tackling broad social and political through the use of appealing imagery and precisely scripted performances."

            "text": "(1985, Ireland) is an artist and game designer based in Los Angeles. Exploring the realms of 3D animation, his subversive style is instantly recognizable, balancing giddy humour with nightmarish scenarios, childlike characters with severe and significant circumstances. Known for his seemingly unrefined, low-polygonal aesthetic, he uses animation with a demiurge-like mindset, to create worlds. He recently created Everything, an interactive game and experience where everything you see is a thing you can be, from animals to planets to galaxies and beyond. Creator of the influential short films Please Say Something and The External World, his animation work has won numerous awards and been the subject of several international retrospectives. He has lectured at Pixar, Harvard, Yale, USC, CalArts and at many other conferences and festivals around the world. He has written for Adventure Time & South Park, and created fictional video games in Spike Jonze’s Academy Award winning film 'Her'."

He is currently PHD researcher at LUCA School of Arts in Ghent/Brussels and affiliated researcher at the Laboratory of Education and Society at KU Leuven. In his process-based art practice he uses a broad range of different methods and outputs merging participatory strategies with a social and ecological relevance, in between leisure and education. The last years he worked extensively on zoological issues and observed the phenomena of zoo culture from different angles. With the Argentinian choreographer/dancer Barbara Pereyra he co-founded Fantaman Productions & Matelisto Contemporary Movements, a platform for developing projects in between performance and visual arts. He is represented by Waldburger Wouters in Brussels."

            "text": "(1981, France) explores drawing as a communication tool, playing with codes ranging from natural sciences to comics via medieval enluminures and children color books. In an endless quest for the right tone, through the format of etudes, Adrien Vermont has fine-tuned a unique handwriting embedding all the above mentioned reference in a seemingly universal visual language, focussed on animals. His bold figures and striking colors often carry antinomic ideas and generate frictions. Far from being simply provocative, with these confrontations and through his use of text and language he raises questions of culture, and self-expression of the observed subjects. Adrien studied fine arts in Beaux Arts, Paris. Currently based in Brussels he has an reclusive atelier-based artistic production, where commitment, repetition and practice are at work."
