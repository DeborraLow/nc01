The project’s charge was to address the large subject of biodiversity in relation to ecological questions in the equally vast and diverse nation of Indonesia. The winning curators, along with the selected artists, would be given the opportunity to go on a journey to the Indonesian archipelago in order to inspire the content of their proposed project."

Rather than claiming that five Europeans traveling to a far away place would even be able to go through a meaningful experience and return with new insights about issues of biodiversity, we asked: what would it mean to simply stay at home? How could we ‘know’ a subject or place solely as the result of a filtered or mediated experience and aesthetic, placed at a remove from the ‘authentic’, or the ‘real’ confrontation? After all, palm oil moistens our lips and skins, and smiling, endangered species feature happily on our cereal packaging."

We were finally persuaded to travel to Indonesia, each of us defining our own itineraries. During those weeks in the country, we traveled to different sites and places, enthralled by volcanoes and mangroves, tricked into the spectacle of lush nature. In fairness, we were more inclined to explore the global stakes and agendas behind modes of representing the ‘natural world’ than to work around the specificity and complexity of Indonesian biodiversity, which we felt was not ours to speak about. Finally, we pulled our eyes away from Internet articles, imperial travelogues, and business plans, in favour of real encounters and conversations with artists and activists across Indonesia, whose first-hand experiences put the information we had consumed in a different light."

Defining a biogeographic region that is at once both a rich reservoir of biodiversity and threatened with destruction, this terms is associated with different modes of representation—think of images of exotic tropical resorts in tourist guides or scenes of massive monoculture plantations in documentary photography. Yet images of biodiversity hotspots only offer a partial view. Their high profile of coincides with a tendency to concentrate conservation efforts on zones in the world with high terrestrial concentrations of endemic species, in order to be more ‘effective’ and ‘impactful’, while disregarding less diverse areas."

The contemporary notion of ‘nature as economy’ has its roots in nineteenth century, colonial, scientific discovery and eco-imperialist narratives, influenced by the legacy of the eighteenth century, Swedish natural scientist Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy. In his dissertation <i>Oeconomia naturae</i> (1749), Linnaeus described the ‘economy of nature’ as its orderliness and its harmonious equilibrium. Linnaeus’ classification theory, though stereotypical and erroneous, shaped work by naturalists such as Charles Darwin, who in turn influenced German biologist Ernst Haeckel in the foundation of  ecology as a discipline. In the making of natural knowledge by means of systemic illustrations, maps, tables, and diagrams of species, Linnaeus contributed to the construction of new rational systems of classifying nature.<sup>1</sup> One could argue that Linnaeus’ foundational work, based as it was around \"notions of equilibria\" as \"checks and balances and feedback loops\",<sup>2</sup> already served as the groundwork for understanding nature as capital."

This indifference toward indigenous knowledge still holds today, as CELIA LOWE argues in her contribution <i>Making The Money</i>—a plea for a “postcolonial refiguration, not only of how science’s matter is made but of where and by whom”. In the island archipelago of the Dutch East Indies (now the Republic of Indonesia), it was Alfred Russel Wallace who was making nature by structurally assembling a large collection of animals and plants. Describing and visualising them as scientific specimens in his travel chronicles, he too reinforced a Cartesian dualism between human and nonhuman, contributing—perhaps unwittingly—to the modern devaluation of diverse life-forms."

The design of maps, as grids laid over natural landscapes, turned insular, opaque, illegible land, into visible, controllable territory and resources. One of the most renowned colonial maps is the meticulously detailed map of Java by the Dutch-German botanist and geologist Friedrich Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn, which “provided both evidence of the colonised territory and an instrument for its further domination.”<sup>4</sup> Not only did the map serve as an imperial weapon of “colonial domination guiding explicit military campaigns”, it also facilitated “resource extraction and plantation management”.<sup>5</sup> This spatial colonisation, through strategies of both literally and metaphorically mining the landscape’s resources was accompanied by a cultural colonisation, supported and made visible by the Mooie Indie movement. Exemplifying the concept of the ‘aesthetical service’ provided by nature—a discreet and insidious application of the notion of natural capital—, artists of the Dutch Indies specialised in a genre of painting which captured romantic depictions of the country; landscape scenes, showing volcanoes, mountains, river valleys, and villages emerging in golden sunshine. The style Mooie Indie, its title coming from the eponymous series of paintings by the Dutch artist Fredericus Jacobus van Rossum du Chattel, contributed to propagating an image of an idyllic nature, conceived for our enjoyment. Far before any form of digital imagery or photo documentation, artists were playing a crucial role in mediating Indonesia’s natural landscape to the world."

Throughout the twentieth century, economic, cultural, and environmental injustice remained firmly in place in Indonesia, despite the country’s colonial independence, evidenced, for example, by deforestation, the displacement of peoples and animals, the depletion of the earth’s resources, and the exploitation of cheap and unpaid labor. On the other hand, awareness about the planet’s fragility and uniqueness slowly grew. In 1969, architect Buckminster Fuller published his acclaimed essay <i>Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth<sup>6</sup>,</i>offering an apt metaphor for a new ideal of planetary management. Yet universalising ideas of a “whole earth”, a “Blue Marble”, or  a new “ecology” as a systems-oriented view of the natural world proved to be biased and incomplete, once again representing the world as a totality to be governed."

Where one might imagine clean oceans and healthy forests to be priceless, they are often understood as global assets valued in economic terms as ‘natural capital’. The term ‘natural capital’ was coined by Ernst Friedrich Schumacher in 1973 as an economic concept that we have come to understand as the world’s assets of natural resources—such as air, water, and soil—capable of flowing into goods and services. The idea of describing natural resources not as “income” but as “capital” subject to depletion coincided with a growing awareness of the value of nature. But by describing the value of nature only in economic terms, we collapse its intrinsic worth into a system of capital flow and exchange, rather than bearing with other possible narratives such as speculation or care. No doubt, there must be more liberating and emancipatory concepts to describe the natural commons than their current management, quantification, and representation under the banner of ‘natural capital’."

According to Demos, we need to develop an alternative visual culture and vocabulary in order to combat the geoengineering solutions offered by techno-utopians whose visual culture “reinforces humanity’s mastery of nature through digital satellite photography and data visualizations in the form of maps, graphs, and virtual simulations.” <sup>10</sup> In this regard, we can observe a change.

They look into what kind of knowledge and strategies are needed to speak meaningfully about nature. By bringing in more sensorial, poetic, and intuitive approaches (MARTIN BELOU), joined with local accounts (SETU LEGI, MIRA ASRININGTYAS), minor narratives (BAKUDAPAN, ELISABETH IDA, RACHEL MONOSOV), ‘unscientific’ forms of representation (SYAIFUL GARIBALDI, FILIP VAN DINGENEN, ADRIEN VERMONT, ADRIEN MISSIKA), non-anthropocentric experiences (YUKI AGRIARDI, DAVID O’REILLY), and different ethics or politics in caring for the environment (YASMINE OSTENDORF), the contributors retrieve a more direct experience of nature. The contributions often return to the concrete and the personal, at times referring to animism and rituals which, though still strong in Indonesia, are too often dismissed as irrational and unscientific. Other contributors deconstruct and question the processes of the scientific production of nature (CELIA LOWE), the economic logic of turning life into financial assets (COOKING SECTIONS, ALEXIS GAUTIER, JIMMY HENDRICKX), the visual culture surrounding natural capital (T.J. DEMOS), and the artificiality of a natureculture (OFFSHORE STUDIO), asking for more emancipatory ways to deal with biodiversity. As Bonneuil and Fressoz have put it, “to strive for decent lives means freeing ourselves from repressive institutions, from alienating dominations and imaginaries. It can be an extraordinary emancipatory experience.” <sup>13</sup> By allowing abstraction, opacity, and poetry to come in, perhaps we can attribute other forms of value to our environment than those of “natural capital”."

In De Certeau’s words, “Stories are becoming private and sink into the secluded place in the neighbourhoods, families, or individuals […] while memories are a sort of anti-museum: it is not localizable.”<sup>1</sup> Yet, the invisible builds up into layers and layers which make up a place."

Travel (like walking) is a substitute for the legends that used to open up space to something different—the return to nearby exoticism by way of a detour through distance places.<sup>2</sup> Each time when I return from my erratic escape, I invite someone (an artist, musician, historian, etc.) for a residency to explore whether my fascination of this place is sharable. The residency itself is a slow developing process which started in early 2014. The slowness is one of the visible qualities of Kaliurang that I implemented in curating 900mdpl. Away from the hustle bustle of the city of Yogyakarta; Kaliurang is the place where quiet streets are surrounded by lush greenery, cool air, tranquillity, and only the faint sound of the neighbour chit-chats flowing with the wind every now and then."

To open up a private house and share it with other people for a long period of time can be challenging. It requires trust, comfort, intimacy, and openness. This is applied not only in the physical presence of the house and the role of the host in welcoming the guest; but also in its non-physical present of the stories and local legends—whether or not the host, the native people of Kaliurang, are willing to share the stories to the visitors. Stories can be very personal and openness allows one to become vulnerable. This required generosity on the part of the people and in the other side of the exchange, the artist needs to earn the trust of the local people, observe the invisible features, and work within the mundane of everyday life."

At this point, the conversation about cultural identity and roots as capital begins. In this case, my position as a native was something I considered a privilege as a host—something to always be conscious about and to only use in moderation. The depth of my roots in Kaliurang can be viewed as a useful source of local knowledge and connection within this project—while the position of the visiting artists as observers, have the privilege of distance to offer fresh perspective."

It was the generous contribution of the community (in Kaliurang and in the art scene) that made it happen: the people who shared their personal stories, those people who are generous enough to share their time interpreting oral histories from one of the oldest member of the community; the people who let us use their personal infrastructures, spare land, hotel lobby, restaurant, and volcano observatory office for project presentation site, and the families who invited the artists to join the dinners and lunches every now and then. My root, as one of the member of the society, soon translated into an asset—a non-monetary capital of infrastructures that does not belong to me. It is something that I would take for granted until someone pointed it out and call it by its name. It was not only because to contribute something to the project gives them a sense of belonging to the project; but also, we share the same concern—an impulse to make a note, to remember, and to archive. For example, one of the oldest members of the community approached me the other day in a waiting room; he began telling me a long comprehensive story about his ancestors and the family line. He even offered to write them down for me so that I could revisit the notes one day. That was the first time I actually had a long conversation with him so I asking him why he would burst into sharing such comprehensive oral history with me; and he said, “Because I know you believe in nonsense and you care enough to preserve it”. For me, that is the least that I can do."

Each time an eruption occurs, the people who live at the slope of the volcano believe that the kingdom of Mt.Merapi celebrates—the eruption is considered as a process of rejuvenation, granting the people in the slope with ash rain that makes the land fertile. It was not until Mt.Merapi changed shape in 2010 has people started to fear him. Along with the changing shape and explosive tendency, Mt.Merapi feels foreign and threatening. In the big eruption in 2010, 320,000 people were evacuated from the dangerous area and the death toll was more than 350 casualties. The aftermath left many villages burned down and buried in ashes. For the first time in many years, the volcano triggered paranoia among people with such a real threat and danger. The sense of impermanence is getting stronger; especially in populated places that has proximity to the crater. Kaliurang, 8 kilometres away from the crater, is pulsing with a silent sense of temporality.

The third generation of the shop owner is a man who chooses a quieter path with profound passion for antiques and history of mundane objects from all over the world. Simon Kentgens is an artist from Rotterdam who chose to work with the owner of Warung Joyo, the antique shop. He explores the shop as some kind of social space where not only products get exchanged, but also news, anecdotes, gossip, and history. As a result, he presented a video work containing short explanation on why a certain object is special to the owner.  How trivial these objects sometimes seem to be, they can show us our interdependency with local and global economies, history, our neighbours and the world. At the same time, he creates a dry museum-like cataloguing of the items being sold in the shop and posts it in  <a href=\"http://instagr.am/warung_joyo\">instagram</a>. Can a local shop function as some sort of museum of contemporary relations? One in which these objects and stories are not fixed, like in a traditional museum, but constantly moving, changing and exchanging?"

For most of his lifetime, Lik Sigun used to live in that house, undisturbed by the world that going by around him. He owned a motorcycle that which he had decorated with the Indonesian flag but instead of riding it, he would take it for a walk on regular basis. He learned self-defence to protect those he cared the most. He made sword in the middle of the night using scraps of metal he collected on the way. When his goat died, instead of burying it, he tied the animal’s four legs on the house poles to let it rotten and dried. Three years ago, he went missing in the forest of confusion, not yet to be found. Taking on his own method in painting, Maryanto let the grass overgrown the remnant of the house to later trim the weed and highlight the part where the ‘artworks’ made by Lik Sigun are hidden; creating a conceptual landscape of remembrance."

When looking at the video documentations presented in this exhibition, one can trace the changes in the landscape and politic of spaces in Kaliurang from 2014 to the present time: half of the tennis court has been transformed into parking lot, a beautiful old house was torn down and changed into a big concrete building, the once-abandoned swimming pool where is now back to business, and many more."

Soon enough he made new friends while responding to different interactions by producing new artworks for what he later refers as his ‘solo exhibition’. In no time, he start mimicking local activities by trading handmade walking sticks, volunteering on the afternoon school for senior citizens by creating an acting class, and get himself involved in the local’s endless attempt to promote the area.

For this work, she chose a storage room that used to be a shop by the street where neighbours are passing by. During her first residency, she collected information about several well-known types of vegetation that were indigenous to Kaliurang and how it interconnected with the locals. When she starts tracing the passage of the plants, she vaguely saw a plant circulation map brimming with human touch. This distinctive dissemination pattern portrays its communal connectedness. As the result, she discovered an exceptional bond between plants and the people of Kaliurang that she presented in “Botanica 1.1: Vanda Tricolor and Other Findings”. Instead of finding the formal dissemination of the native plants, she found out how unreserved the way people in Kaliurang socialized and exchange with their neighbours. This time, Edita tries to simulate this exchange by preparing a non-monetary trading space called “Taman Tukar” (Swap Garden) especially to accommodate people around Kaliurang to meet their neighbours, exchange domestic plants, and share information about them. All the information are documented and openly displayed for public access."

This project, initiated as the subprime mortgage crisis started to be noticed, ventured to protect citizens from the effects of air pollution and climate change. Working to add the eponymous amount of trees to the city, MTNYC was considered the largest urban afforestation effort in the world. Highlighting the benefits of improved air quality, increased shading, and reduced energy consumption, the majority of trees were planted in low income neighborhoods with poor tree canopy and high asthma rates. The aspiration was to increase the city’s “urban resilience” in times of devaluation of real estate assets and ecological collapse. The project was accompanied by an extensive community-based survey that invited people to document trees in their neighborhood. This promoted the caretaking and mapping of the different species by involving  “the community” in that process. Volunteers contributed 12,000 hours of their own time, worth an estimated $100,000, inventorying the city’s trees. As a consequence, each single tree in the city was assigned an economic value based on the “environmental services” it performed."

Is this a second wave of what David Gissen refers to as “environmental gentrification” initiated in NYC during the 1970s? Before current quantifications that assign figures and formulae to plants, their value was extracted in a more direct way. When British Empire forestry was first established as a disciplinary practice in India, formalizing the right of the state over “nature,” it proscribed private interests and initiated a new system of forest management based on a logic of utilitarian preservation. Rather than the actual survival of plants or animals, the goal of this forestry was focused on preventing the exhaustion of resource extraction. Using the universal goodness of plants to prevent indigenous peoples from living off the forest for the sake of the “environment,” Empire forestry eventually masqueraded a form of biopolitical control, limiting access to the forest for its original dwellers. Furthermore, the extraction of commodities from every single tree (timber, rubber, or pharmaceutical substances) has been used as a form of ecocracy throughout history: controlling space and people through the conservation of ecology. This conservation paradigm implied that the ruling class could keep extracting material resources from trees without exhausting the forest. As Arun Agrawal articulates with his notion of environmentality, much before the pacifist Chipko movement of the 1970s, the reclassification of forests into designated reserves led villagers in Northern India to resist becoming environmental subjects through violent actions. They started hundreds of forest fires in the early 1920s to protest colonial British regulations that were passed to “protect the environment” from the harms the Empire itself inflicted."

The extraction of value from trees does not imply subtraction of physical matter (sap, bark, leaves, roots, or oil extracts), but rather precisely by keeping all that materiality intact and in place. Trees have turned into carbon reserves that are to be protected from any form of indigenous, domestic, or industrial usage, so that they keep acting as fixed carbon sinks. Contemporary struggles in Niassa, Mozambique against the neocolonial logic of “afforestation projects” reflect similar uprisings in early twentieth century India, where forests are being “preserved” to offset air pollution in cities of the global North. In protest of consequent land dispossessions, thousands of pine trees planted by multinational “Green Resources” corporation were uprooted in 2013."

Utilizing the Tree Carbon Calculator (TCC), a federally approved spreadsheet developed by the Center for Urban Forest Research, the yearly capacity of stormwater interception, energy conservation, air pollutant removal, and CO2 reduction prefigures each tree on the database. Plugging this latter set of information into an algorithm behind environmental investment software allows the TCC to accurately calculate the annual financial benefits provided by each one of those trees, which developers or industrialists who have to mitigate their environmental damage can pay to “neutralize” the detrimental effect of their activities."

Today, however, the Ford Foundation atrium is losing greenwashing capacity to the six thornless honey locusts right outside, on 309 East 42nd street, and another six in front of the façade on 320 East 43rd street. They measure between three and eleven inches in diameter. One of them in particular intercepts ten dollars and twelve cents worth of stormwater, conserves one hundred and fifteen dollars and fifty one cents worth of energy, removes eight dollars and twenty-one cents worth of air pollutants, sequesters one dollar and thirty-eight cents worth of CO2, providing a total of $136.59 in annual benefits."

Throughout the five boroughs of NYC, all mapped trees are annually providing one hundred and ten million, six hundred and seventy-three thousand, seven hundred and eighty-eight dollars and twenty cents. Now marked with a fully articulated and mathematically sound price tag, trees can automatically become objects of transaction and start to offset environmental damage from any development elsewhere. Planting trees is thus the outcome of an emerging and carefully engineered government of financial flows: the cartography of street trees constitutes a dataset for the calculation of “environmental services” (the services that nature suddenly provides to humans). By means of the software, these services can be turned into “financial gains” that the city can start accumulating by benefiting from environmental destruction."

The degree of authority of those paying for the environmental services of each tree is uncertain, despite the trees being rooted in public soil. In this case, what is conserved is not just trees to improve air quality in the city, but also its real estate capital flows. Humans and other-than-humans thus become financial victims of conservation. Trees that provide environmental services for offsetting purposes could, as has happened in places like India or Mozambique, be prioritized over aesthetic, health, or ecological concerns."

According to No Net Loss, any development that destroys natural habitats (especially wetlands, streams or vernal pools) has to be recouped by the restoration of an “equivalent” landscape elsewhere. The net amount of biodiversity is meant to remain “the same” in terms of surface, quality, or quantity. For each acre of lost wetland, for instance, there should be at least one acre created or restored. This one-for-one logic becomes perverse when the idea of preservation gets thrown into the mix: a developer can destroy a forest for the construction of a condominium on site A and pay a third-party entity owning an equivalent amount of trees on site B to preserve them. Like the trading of air-rights to build higher developments, this logic of urban afforestation has evolved into more sophisticated forms. Air pollution can be legitimized as long as it is traded with planting and keeping trees untouched that absorb the equivalent amount of CO2. The US government has recently updated its social cost of carbon to $37 a ton, which refers to the total social and environmental benefits that accrue from avoiding the emission of one ton of CO2, or alternatively, the damage done by releasing that ton of CO2. Once these equivalences are set, trading can easily commence."

Eventually, spatial offsets are directly entangled with the offsetting, and obfuscation of responsibility. As María Gutiérrez remarks, even if such a mechanism of spatial offsetting was to be considered environmentally sensitive, it is not clear yet who is accountable if, for instance, the mitigation forest catches fire or succumbs to a disease, releasing all the “stored carbon” back into the atmosphere. Hence, environmental mitigation and holding trees accountable as a solution remains nebulous."

In the 1980s biologists shifted from providing facts about the natural world (already social constructions themselves) to start speaking of nature’s “values.” As facts were not enough, subjective valuation of nature started playing a more ambiguous active role, malleable enough to different economic interests. There are many ways of valuing, but unlike the concept of wilderness, the moment “natural variety” appeared (the fact that species are different and contribute differently to the ecological balance of a habitat), the gradients of environmental importance to biodiversity easily became a commodity that could be compared, exchanged, lost, gained, depleted, restored, quantified, and scientized; allowing metaphors such as “balance of nature” to disguise poor understandings of ecology."

Air pollution in the Global North was accepted as a lesser evil of modernization if compensated with “sustainable” afforestation programs in the Global South that “enhanced global biodiversity.” Offset forest projects turned environmental guilt into a tradable commodity. Rich nations became entitled to keep polluting as long as they ensure that impoverished nations keep their forests intact, or their land grabbed to green the planet. Some of the ethical contradictions in this postcolonial logic were obviously reinstating abusive power dynamics within a pseudo-environmentalist discourse, as in one of the first post-Kyoto offsetting projects, where US-based Applied Energy Services promised to plant millions of trees on the highland hills of Western Guatemala in exchange for permission to construct a large, coal-burning power station in Connecticut. This “participatory” planting project, branded as Mi Bosque, was calculated to absorb as much CO2 from the environment as would be produced by the power station over its lifetime. It was meant to sequester between 15.5 and 16.3 million tons of carbon over 40 years, but according to a report, only 270,000 tons of carbon were offset by the project over the first ten years. Therefore, the ways in which any carbon footprint is neutralized through corporate social responsibility only exacerbates the still-colonial relationships between the rich and the poor, between high carbon-emitting nations’ right to pollute and enjoy and low carbon-emitting nations obligation to cleanse and labor."

Nations and companies are competing to appropriate the last piece of available “untapped” forest that can provide the most amount of “environmental services.” A green space race to designate space itself as a protected zone. Eco-utilities and forest bonds are some of the instruments that are boosting the neoliberal quantification of space embedded in that process and determining how to classify and demarcate it. The main challenge for this form of speculation, however, is how and whether to make offsetting calculations standard and universal. In order to securitize ecology, the definition of the “values” of each single tree are crucial. For that operation, standard measurements to quantify forests properties would be necessary. However, such agreement on a transnational form of currency or valuing units has yet to happen. No governmental body has proven offsetting mechanisms as simultaneously financially efficient and environmentally successful."

Ernst Friedrich Schumacher further articulated this morphology when, after the 1973 oil crisis and the accessibility of fossil fuels was under threat for Western powers, he posited the idea of natural capital. Further still, Paul Hawken, Amory Lovins, and Hunter Lovins expanded the lexicon into the notion of natural capitalism at the end of the twentieth century, framing natural capitalism within the notion of eco-efficiency—how to make sense of nature by making money—and arguing that environmental sensitivity is so necessary to shareholders that for the sake of business, corporations should be careful not to miss out. Natural capitalism did not refer to capitalism as being a natural phenomenon to humanity, as it was misunderstood at the time, but as something embedded in the trading of nature. This vision implies that the environment has its own assets waiting for human stewards to make the most of them."

Hence, the rise of stewardship principles reflects the spatiality of a neoliberal economy, legitimizing environmental protection in order to regulate the extraction of value. This process of raising awareness about the value of trees for the city is equivalent to the so-called “Cousteauization” of the oceans: a popular movement to cultivate public interest in the ocean’s biota, through figures like Captain Jacques Cousteau, in order to generate financial support for further marine research and governmental and/or corporate stewardship of marine resources. In that regard, neoliberal environmental conservation can extract even more value by “protecting” nature in order to further boost the speculation on its exploitation, be it real estate potential or prospective natural resources. This perverse logic profiteering from environmental protection is what Bram Büscher and Robert Fletcher frame as “accumulation by conservation.”"

On the contrary, they will carry on instrumentalizing “resilience” in order to create new markets. New forms of capital are monetizing the environment through the banking of nature. Increasingly after the collapse of the housing market in 2007–2008, an ever-increasing number of international investors and credit institutions shifted their activity from real estate speculation to trading natural capital. What we are observing in New York is just one example of a booming market in which inhabitants of the city are environmentally dispossessed by a price tag on its trees. In this transformation process, a neighborhood like East New York, comprised of a population of which more than 50% live under the poverty line, is now becoming one of the highest valued areas of urban trees in the whole city, generating annual benefits of millions of dollars in environmental services for offsetting powers. Very quickly some of the most vulnerable people in the city could be also offset, swept away under a new speculative market where the environment serves as a driving force for new forms of dispossession, real estate speculation, and green “renewal.” The offsetted (humans and other-than-humans) are a new social class that stands not to be displaced, but replaced by trees. Trees might be purifying the air on-site, but the financial value of each tree does not stay in front of citizens’ houses. The double agenda of calculating the carbon footprint for each tree, and the services it provides, exposes how every tree of New York is connected to a very specific architectural site of destruction. It is the responsibility of architects and realtors to de-quantify the “value” of trees instead of profiteering from them and what they offset."

Biologists estimate annual loss of species at 1,000 times or more greater than historic rates, and linguists predict that 50–90%of the world’s languages will disappear by the end of this century. Prior studies indicate similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity in regions containing many of the Earth’s remaining species: biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary among localities, although strong geographic concordance between biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity. The results reported in this article provide a starting point for focused research exploring the relationship between biological and linguistic– cultural diversity, and for developing integrated strategies designed to conserve species and languages in regions rich in both."

Possibly more. After this, Suharto remained in power for 32 more years. In 1998, he was eventually forced to resign as President of Indonesia under pressure of the population and the international political community. Today, Indonesians still talk about 1965-66, especially in the weeks prior to September.

From 1984, students of 6 or 7 years old had to watch the propaganda film Pengkhianatan G30S / PKI (Treason of G30S / PKI) on TV each evening of September 30th. The next morning your teachers questioned you about it. The generation of my slightly older sister was forced to watch the film in a cinema with locked doors. The film is a government-manipulated version of the coup attempt translated into a docudrama with very 'cheesy' but 'creepy' music. You mainly see atrocities such as the face of a general mutilated with a razor. Children were forced to see all that horror. You can only imagine how deep the hatred was. The film was one of our few permitted sources regarding the history of Indonesia. Even today, those events in schoolbooks are still being manipulated. It was only when I came to Belgium and could distance myself that I saw how much a truth was taught to me that turned out to be one big lie."

In the film, you don’t see anything of that lugubrious history. You only see the natural beauty that characterises Indonesia. The cave was completely cleaned up in the eighties and is nowadays a tourist attraction for foreign tourists. For locals access is too expensive. Relatively few people can enter each day because everyone wants to see the so-called celestial light that enters the cave opening around 12 o'clock in the afternoon. I have entered twice. The first time with a tour guide to hear what he would tell. That turned out to be very disappointing: no word was spoken about 1965-66, just as nature is silent. The title of the work Silent Witness is based on the book Guilty Landscapes by Armando. Nature seems innocent and impartial, but you can also view it differently. It can grow and thrive on human remains and serves as a cover for murders and assaults. In this way, nature is an accomplice."

While all traces were wiped out in Indonesia, the genocide in Cambodia was extensively documented, eventually making possible a trial of the regime. In Indonesia we can only dream about that kind of documentation. In order to arrive at proof, the law must first be amended in which it is still stated that Communism is forbidden. This prohibition must first be lifted before 1965-66 can openly be discussed."

The online publication features commissioned contributions and interviews with artists and theorists living in Indonesia, Belgium, and elsewhere, written in English and Bahasa Indonesia. The format of the online publication was conceived as a platform to enable artworks and ideas to travel outside of Belgium, to generate a new dimension of artistic production, and to bypass the constraints of the physical exhibition.

He often creates performative situations and experiences using the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.

Tepu’s works show a remarkably strong vision of art that collides with science in a graceful manner. His creation of an immersive environment was sparked by his interest in the networked and interconnected nature of ecologies, and the evocative power of microorganisms as symbols of death and decay, as well as life. Infusion between art and science transcends through Tepu’s work and gives way to a new gateway of knowledge, which is illuminated within his prints and installations.

In 1998, he and his friends established the Taring Padi art and cultural community. He is now more focused on his individual practice. Setu Legi’s central concern is the rapid growth and the exploitation of natural resources. Seeing natural diversity being replaced with patterns of uniformity has brought the artist to question the idea of progress and the humans’ willingness to make nature bend to their needs. His reflections are articulated across different media, from terracotta sculptures to paintings, drawings and installations. He tackles specific environmental issues such as plantation-based systems of production and consumption, land exploitation, deforestation and the impacts on traditional communities."

Her work in Indonesia concerns the travels of scientific knowledge, especially biological knowledge, between EuroAmerica and Southeast Asia. Her first book, Wild Profusion: Biodiversity Conservation in an Indonesian Archipelago, published by Princeton in 2006, examined the role of Indonesian’s conservation biology in the creation of a new national park in the Togean Islands of Indonesia. She is currently working on a book on the recent H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in Indonesia and is interested in the way new forms of biosecurity and risk were in play in relation to the disease. Lowe has also consulted with the Ford Foundation, Conservation International, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the Asian University for Women in this field."

Willing to overcome a possible all-digital experience of the world and to tackle his deep frustration regarding a noxious human action on nature, he embeds in his works his acute perception of being present - in a physical space, at a certain time, within a given culture. He subverts the notions of exoticism and cultural appropriation in multimedia productions that highlight the frictions and incompatibilities between natural and manmade, and the absurdities that ensue.Through a wide range of media, from photography, video, to sculpture and installation, the artist records his finds encountered during travels. Adrien studied at Ecole Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne (ECAL) in Lausanne, and is currently living and working in Berlin."

Her artistic practice bridges photography, video, performance, and sculpture, and delves into cultural notions of alienation, territorial belonging, gender, and identity. Nature serves as a source for the artist’s imagery and objects, which can be interpreted as both symbolic and indexical. In her recent works, Monosov lets the borders between private life and artistic performance blurr, therefore lets a questioning about authenticity, fantasy and fiction settle in her latest artworks. The act of presenting, representing and the communication between the artist the artwork and the public is of a growing importance in her practice.  While seemingly self-focussed and almost autobiographical, Monosov’s artworks subtly succeeds in tackling broad social and political through the use of appealing imagery and precisely scripted performances."

Exploring the realms of 3D animation, his subversive style is instantly recognizable, balancing giddy humour with nightmarish scenarios, childlike characters with severe and significant circumstances. Known for his seemingly unrefined, low-polygonal aesthetic, he uses animation with a demiurge-like mindset, to create worlds. He recently created Everything, an interactive game and experience where everything you see is a thing you can be, from animals to planets to galaxies and beyond. Creator of the influential short films Please Say Something and The External World, his animation work has won numerous awards and been the subject of several international retrospectives. He has lectured at Pixar, Harvard, Yale, USC, CalArts and at many other conferences and festivals around the world. He has written for Adventure Time & South Park, and created fictional video games in Spike Jonze’s Academy Award winning film 'Her'."

The last years he worked extensively on zoological issues and observed the phenomena of zoo culture from different angles.

In an endless quest for the right tone, through the format of etudes, Adrien Vermont has fine-tuned a unique handwriting embedding all the above mentioned reference in a seemingly universal visual language, focussed on animals. His bold figures and striking colors often carry antinomic ideas and generate frictions. Far from being simply provocative, with these confrontations and through his use of text and language he raises questions of culture, and self-expression of the observed subjects. Adrien studied fine arts in Beaux Arts, Paris. Currently based in Brussels he has an reclusive atelier-based artistic production, where commitment, repetition and practice are at work."
